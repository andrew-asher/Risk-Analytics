# Risk-Analytics
Risk Analytics in Banking &amp; Financial Services helps financial institutions assess loan applicants by identifying key risk factors through data analysis. The project uses EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to detect patterns in applicant data and previous loan histories, helping optimize loan approvals, reduce defaults, and enhance risk management.
